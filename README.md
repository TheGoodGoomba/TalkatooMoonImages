# Talkatoo Moon Images
A simple Winforms app that complements the [Talkatoo Translator](https://github.com/AzHarcos/talkatoo-translator) by AzHarcos and Biakko by showing images of moons that Talkatoo mentions in Talkatoo% speedruns.

Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/fbk-O3lpr7E) for a short demonstration of its use.

## How to use
Download the .zip from the latest release, extract the files and then run TalkatooMoonImages.exe. (Note that you'll need the [.NET 6.0 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) to run this).

Type the path of the `pending-moons.txt` file generated by the Translator or click `Browse` to get the path, and then click `Start Monitoring File`.

As the Translator detects moons and puts them in the text file, they will show up along with a picture in the window. Make sure the correct kingdom is selected or else the images will be for the wrong moons!

That's basically it - hopefully it works lol.

## Limitations
At the moment, you have to have the kingdom selected in the program for the right pictures to load, even though I'm pretty sure each moon name is unique across the game. I might change that in the future (but it's not that hard to click a button while the Odyssey is powering up).

The moon images are from the [Mario Wiki](mariowiki.com), so they're not the best in terms of what a runner might need to see to remember a moon in a run. I might get some better ones, but you can also change the images by replacing the files in the `Images` folder. (Each kingdom has its own subfolder, and each moon is named [number].png).

Please note that this probably will not stop Talkatoo from giving you hint art and both Cold Room moons in Snow.

No Talkatoos were harmed in the making of this tool.
